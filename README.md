## What Problem Does the App Solve
This app is an intro to express.js. It introduces me to GET and POST requests and how to use those to handle traffic and displays.

## App Overiew
The app is organized by files and within each file, by functions or flow. Each .js file has code specific to it's use case and within there, is organized by function. The .html files are organized by flow.

## How to Use the App
